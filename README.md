# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game  where the player starts as a dot and grows into a snake by capturing or 'eating' pieces of food. The more the snake grows the higher the chance of eating its self leading to game-over which increases the difficulty level. The goal is to grow the snake as as much as possible with out hitting the walls or 'eating' its self.


This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
